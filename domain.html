                                <p class="description">The area of Decentralized applications has gained traction recently. With static content sharing networks such as IPFS, and browsers such as beaker browser, mist, decentralization of the internet has begun. Introduction of Orb with its unique capability of providing Serverless functions
                                    replicated and decentralized through a network of nodes with a unique Rewarding system, the
                                    users are able to deploy Serverless functions which could be used as services in a more
                                    decentralized internet. The idea of services being decentralized is unique. Therefore, there were
                                    no direct similar work which is equivalent to Orb but there were systems built focusing on the
                                    decentralization, Reward Distribution, Static content Distribution and Torrents. The
                                    commercialization of the orb is achieved by attracting users to use the network as service providers
                                    or service users.</p>

                                        1. AWS Lambda <br/><br/>
                                        Amazon web services lambda is also providing server space for the functions to be deployed. With
                                        AWS Lambda, it’s possible to run code for virtually any type of application or backend service
                                        - all with zero administration. AWS Lambda runs the code on a high-availability computer
                                        infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the computer resources, including server
                                        and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring
                                        and logging. Comparing Orb to Lambda is impossible since the concept of Lambda is more
                                        centralized where as Orb is fully Decentralized. But the idea of focusing more towards the service
                                        itself rather than relying on background is common to both AWS Lambda and Orb.

                                        Steemit is a social network and a content rewards platform that makes the crowd the
                                        beneficiaries of the attention economy. It does this by rewarding users with STEEM. Steemit is a
                                        social media platform that works by having the crowd reward the crowd for their content. It does
                                        this thanks to the Steem blockchain[18] and cryptocurrency; Steem is 'minted' daily and distributed
                                        to content producers according to the votes they get. Most social media sites extract value from
                                        their user base for the benefit of shareholders alone. Steemit is different, it's a new kind of attention
                                        economy.<br/> By connecting with the Steem blockchain (which is decentralized and controlled by the
                                        crowd), Steemit users receive all the benefits and rewards for their attention. More similar
                                        principals are used in Steemit Rewarding System and Orb but Rewards are for two different
                                        reasons. Steemit focuses more on Rewarding users that have written, contributed and read Steemit
                                        articles whereas Orb focuses more on the deployment, contribution, seeding and consumption of
                                        functions       
                                    </p>

                                        IPFS is a distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the
                                        same system of files. IPFS is a versioned file system that can take files and manage
                                        them and store them somewhere and then tracks versions over time. IPFS also
                                        accounts for how those files move across the network so it is also a distributed file system.

                                        Storj is a platform, cryptocurrency, and suite of decentralized applications that allows you
                                        to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Storj can be faster, cheaper, and more
                                        secure than traditional cloud storage platforms. <br/>Faster because multiple machines are
                                        serving you your file simultaneously, cheaper because you are renting people's spare harddrive
                                        space instead of paying for a purpose-built data center, and more secure because
                                        your file is both encrypted and shredded. Storj uses blockchain features like a transaction
                                        ledger, public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions for security. The
                                        decentralized aspect of Storj means there are no central servers to be compromised, and
                                        with client-side encryption, you are in control of the keys to your files.

                                    <p class="description">The reason why someone would decentralize a function is the avoidance of any central
                                        points of failure. Developers can create, deploy and monetize serverless functions
                                        completely anonymously and users can consume them in full privacy. In a typical
                                        environment, the traffic can be intercepted through a single point using a load balancer
                                        and routed to different servers. But in “Orb”, each supernode acts as a load balancer itself. 
                                        Function calls are mediated by super nodes depending on the latency and number of
                                        requests per second automatically balancing the traffic.<br/><br/>
                                        The attractive feature why a user would host a function on their own machine is, hosting
                                        a function in their own machine will make the node eligible for payment through an
                                        Ethereum contract, a user subscribes to, at the time of deployment. The payments model
                                        works as pay per request terms. More traffic will generate more income. The advantage
                                        of such a model is that user itself can host and deploy at the same time. Then the
                                        deployment cost can be prevented by hosting and contributing more towards the growth
                                        of the network.<br/><br/>
                                        The user will use Orb instead of uploading it in AWS or any other because, decentralizing
                                        cuts the cost, makes the owner completely anonymous, all the transactions made are
                                        verified and more contributions from the user to the network will be paid in terms of ether.
                                        Data ownership and central authority are prevented completely from this approach. At the
                                        end the user gets rewarded which will be proportional to the contributions made to the
                                        system.<br/><br/>
                                        Decentralization comes with drawbacks. Once deployed, how can the owner modify or
                                        deprecates the function? In a decentralized environment, it’s difficult to update functions.
                                        Updates should be managed as versions of that function and tracker always choose the
                                        latest version of the requested function. The older version will get deprecated once the
                                        user issues a request.<br/><br/>
                                        What are the measures for Security at nodes in the system? By default, the system will not
                                        have a central point of failure, which makes the system fully tolerant to DDoS(Distributed
                                        Denial of Service) attacks. The system is also resistant to Man in the middle attacks as
                                        function calls will be redirected through supernodes. Each time, the user might call 2
                                        different nodes in 2 different locations by avoiding a specific route. Only an executable of 
                                        the function will be deployed (without the source code) as a security mechanism. To
                                        ensure that the decentralized functions are not changed, the supernodes will automatically
                                        verify by comparing a dynamically generated hash and the existing hash, each time a peer

                                <p class="description">Today, most of the web services are built around centralized client server architecture. With the
                                    dawn of Serverless computing, usage of Serverless functions have gained traction. In fact, many
                                    colorations have integrated Serverless functions to their core web services. The main advantage of
                                    using Serverless functions is that the developers can focus more towards the implementation of
                                    the function rather than integrating the function with a complex API just to provide an endpoint
                                    for consumption. Serverless functions save time, energy and cost. But these systems comes with
                                    few drawbacks as mentioned below.</p>

                                        AWS provides EC2 service which is used to create virtual machines. The users can easily deploy
                                        web services/applications to EC2. EC2 has built in auto-scaling and have higher reliability
                                        (availability rating of 99.9974 percent, Cloud Harmony reported). Hence more users are attracted
                                        to AWS and from an outside perspective, AWS’ dominant share (40 percent) of the public cloud
                                        services seems like a monopoly in nature. Shares owned by Microsoft Azure (15 percent),
                                        Google’s cloud (7%), and the remaining small percentages picked up by IBM, Oracle, and other
                                        small players in cloud service compared to AWS. Therefore, if AWS suffers from a downtime,
                                        users won’t be able to access 40% of the web services. It’s analogous to a massive breakdown of
                                        the internet services, similar to the massive internet outage happened on February 28th, 2017.

                                        Deploying a function to a third-party services provider always has its drawbacks. The organization
                                        automatically gets the ownership and access to the data. Although service providers like AWS
                                        could be trusted, there is always a risk. In a decentralized system, data is stored in a collection of
                                        nodes. Therefore, a single entity won’t be able to control how the data is stored in the system.

                                        The classic definition of single point of failure is of a potential risk posed by a flaw in the
                                        design, implementation or configuration of a circuit or system in which one fault or malfunction
                                        causes an entire system to stop operating. This problem persists in a small or medium-sized
                                        business where the entire business logic is hosted in a single centralized server. Since that business
                                        might run low on profit affording for cloud computing / AWS will hardly be possible.
                                        Decentralized systems doesn’t have this problem.

                                        Most cloud services serve a large number of clients, thereby generating log of API load. In order
                                        for a system to handle traffic continuously and to serve for incrementing demand, there must be a
                                        way to scale up the system horizontally and vertically. Vertical Scaling includes hardware
                                        upgrades done to the server which increases the cost of hosting the web service. <br/>Horizontal scaling
                                        is achieved by deploying load balances which proxy requests into few identical instances running
                                        the same web service. Running parallel instances cost the user. Generally in AWS, features like
                                        horizontal scaling must be setup of manually. AWS ECS and google App Engine SaaS supports 

                                        horizontal scaling by default. But in the decentralized system, adding more nodes will
                                        automatically scale up the system effortlessly.

                                        5.  Centralized Systems Generate More Traffic <br/><br/>
                                        Since all the business logic implemented as a web service is aggregated in a central location, all
                                        the clients calling the same instance in parallel increases the load average of the server, if not load

                                        balancing cloud lead to a system failure. Decentralization of
                                        the system could prevent from the traffic generation problem since the service is fully decentralized

                                        A Research constraint will be to overcome the communication
                                        between nodes, super nodes behind NATs. The possibility of creating a new protocol to transmit

                                        secure, therefore, usage of secure web sockets for data communication is defined. The mechanisms

                                        2. Deployment framework to deploy functions <br/><br/>
                                        Deployment framework is built on top of node infrastructure at client end to facilitate hosting and
                                        seeding functions. This resides behind the user and act as a wrapper for the API. Client Software
                                        is the GUI for the client. This facilitates from Registration of the user to Deploying a function.
                                        Steps include; authenticating user in the decentralized network, logging to the system, writing a
                                        function, obfuscate the function, packaging and deploying a function, providing access tokens for
                                        the specified function. Main purpose of this is to bridge the gap between client and network
                                        infrastructure.<br/>
                                        Security is maintained throughout the system from registration of user to function deploying and
                                        calling. Although this is a decentralized system, security is good than a centralized network.
                                        Decentralized network is proof of DDoS attacks since all requests are routed in the system via
                                        supernodes. Socket.io plays a role is securing network proofing external attacks.
                                        Packaging is done for security purpose and easy of sharing. JavaScript function is packaged (using
                                        a node library called ‘pkg’) before deploying.<br/>
                                        Obfuscation is the process of making something difficult to understand. JavaScript function is
                                        obfuscated because it’s an intellectual property and it prevent an attacker from reverse engineering
                                        function in the network. It normally renames useful class and variable names to meaningless labels
                                        or adding unused or meaningless code to an application binary. The output after obfuscating is
                                        harder to read and understand.

                                        Initially when the system boots up, there are only known super nodes. When user install client
                                        application client application know what are super node are existing in network. These nodes are
                                        connecting socket streams. Which allow platform to communicate bi-direction. When a client gets
                                        registered in the system, Super Node identify it as a node. Node is identified using unique Orb id.
                                        Even after every node addition, Super Node populates its data which is saved in a DHT throughout
                                        the network. This makes the transparency between Super Node like nodes feel it as a central

                                <p class="description">When the client starts the Orb client software, it will send a request to the supernode and the supernode will start to keep a track of the particular node.

                                    When the user uploads a function through the client, the client will ask the user to subscribe to a payments plan (an ethereum smart contract). Then function will run on the same client machine first. Then function source code will be run through a hash function and hashed. This will generate an initial hash which can be used to identify the function. Also, a key pair will be generated for a particular function. Then the function will be converted to an executable file. Then function will be sent to the supernode.<br/>

                                    The supernode will initially run the function, generates an URL and send to the deployed user. Then supernode will look for the live nodes list and sends a notification about the availability of the function. The nodes can now choose to run the function or not. This way, the functions will be distributed throughout the network.

                                        Super node represents a node with the Orb server installed.

                                        for data analytics are the main functionalities of a super node.
                                        A user can choose to be a super node. But in order to be
                                        a super node, it must be on a public network with a public

                                        is only distributed across the nodes which can only serve the

                                        a function and an endpoint will be generated and sent to
                                        the user. Even though configuration overhead is eliminated.
                                        The functions cannot be edited or removed easily due to the
                                        decentralized nature of the system.

                                        7.  Updating and deprecation of the function<br/><br/>
                                        The deployed user can initiate a function deprecation or
                                        an update. Then this request will be propagated through the
                                        network. The updating and deprecation process will be slow
                                        since the system is decentralized.<br/> Orb will simply minimize
                                        the risk of single point of failure since multiple nodes hold the
                                        responsibility of function availability. In any system usually,
                                        trade-offs are done considering efficiency, reliability security
                                        scalability etc. A decentralized index approach tends to be
                                        more robust (no single point of failure), but it is usually
                                        tricky to make it as efficient as a centralized approach.
                                        Scaling will not cost extra money anymore. <br/>In real world if
                                        the system/software becomes bigger the servers should scale
                                        horizontally or vertically. We can scale our own machines
                                        or use the most common method of using a cloud services
                                        platform but both methods are costly using Orb the expenses
                                        for scaling can be reduced and can be controlled. The function
                                        owner can monitor the usage and if that function exceeds
                                        request limit the owner of the function must pay all the hosted
                                        nodes through an Ethereum contract. <br/>When the user puts the
                                        requested amount of ether to the contract, will be distributed
                                        among the nodes based on the involvement of nodes. Free
                                        server spaces can be utilized to a worthy cause Starting from a
                                        smart phone up to a server farm anyone interested can provide
                                        server space and earn extra rewards. This will reduce the cost
                                        for scaling which is beneficial for the function owner and

                                    Our electron app basically contains a dashboard, inline code editor, Orb wallet, function deploying
                                    interface. Inline code editor enables the user to write code in the application itself. Then these
                                    functions are saved as Javascript files. Later these are obfuscated for security purposes.
                                    When user wants to use a function, application inputs function to a Javascript interpreter and
